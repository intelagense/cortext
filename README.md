# Cortext
Cortext is a short, browser-based, AI-themed interactive fiction game that challenges players to navigate through a series of intriguing dialogues and choices. Designed and developed during the [Super Casual Game Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/super-casual-game-jam-2) hosted by [Lana_Lux](https://lanalux.itch.io/), this game offers a blend of mystery, strategy, and narrative depth, set against the backdrop of a futuristic AI-driven society.

## To-do

- [x] everything else

This repo represents my final submission to the [Super Casual Game Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/super-casual-game-jam-2).

## How it's Made
Cortext was crafted as a static website, leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring its interactive narrative to life. The development process spanned several days, totaling approximately 24 working hours, with a significant portion dedicated to crafting compelling game copy and designing prompts for the AI to generate eerie images. A comprehensive external flowchart played a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the game's multiple branching paths, enabling a seamless narrative experience across various player choices.

## Future Optimizations
- Better styling and behavior for the "mute sound menu icon".
- CSS should accommodate better accessibility and responsiveness on mobile devices.
- The variables used in the `showImage()` function should be in an array or object.

## Lessons learned
Proper sleep is important for your mental health and overall mood.
