## To-do
1. ~~favicon~~
1. ~~everything else~~

This repo represents my final submission to the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/super-casual-game-jam-2">Super Casual Game Jam 2</a>.

## How it's made
The game is a static website that uses JavaScript to manipulate elements on click events. Work was completed over several days in approximately 24 total working hours. The majority of that time was spent writing the game copy as well as prompts for generating the creepy images. An external flowchart was created to track progress and validate game logic against multiple branching paths.

## Optimizations
* Better styling and behavior for the "mute sound menu icon".
* CSS should accomodate better accessibility and responsiveness on mobile devices
* The variables used in the showImage() function should be in an array or object. 

## Lessons learned
Proper sleep is important for your mental health and overall mood.
